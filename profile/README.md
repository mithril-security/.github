## üè† Who are we?

Mithril Security is a security startup focused on democratizing privacy-by-design AI through open-source projects.

Our main product is [BlindChat](https://github.com/mithril-security/blind_chat), a privacy-first Conversational AI, that helps users leverage AI with guarantees their data always remains private.

Thanks to our confidential infrastructure, not even our admins are able to see the prompts sent to our Conversational AI as they remain end-to-end protected. This tackles the growing privacy concerns related to using Conversational AI by enabling users to query AI models without exposing their data to the AI provider. 

BlindChat is a confidential conversational AI deployed with [BlindLlama](https://github.com/mithril-security/blind_llama), our open-source project to serve AI privately by leveraging enclaves.

## üìö Archives

BlindChat builds on our previous open-source projects (some of which are no longer maintained):

- [BlindAI](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai), a solution for querying and deploying AI models while guaranteeing end-user data privacy, audited by [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/).
- [BlindBox](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindbox), a SaaS deployment solution that boosts compliance and improves the security posture of SaaS solutions by shielding end users' data at all times- including from the SaaS providers themselves.
- [BastionLab](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab), an access-control privacy framework for remote data exploration and AI training.
