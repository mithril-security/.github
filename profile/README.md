## üè† Who are we?

Mithril Security develops a data protection and privacy solution for AI analysis. We help SaaS vendors, developers and companies to protect their sensitive data when leveraging SaaS solutions, enabling them to innovate quickly while preventing leakage risks. 

We are experts in Confidential Computing, a cybersecurity technology we use to ensure that data sent to our APIs remains encrypted from end to end.

- [BlindBox](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindbox), our open-source solution to deploy and query SaaS applications while guaranteeing data privacy. 

We're also working on : 
- [Confidential Computing Explained](https://github.com/mithril-security/Confidential_Computing_Explained), a series of beginner-friendly tutorials to learn how to implement confidential computing solutions.
- [BlindAI](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai), an open-source solution to query and deploy AI models while guaranteeing data privacy.
