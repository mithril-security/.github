## 🏠 Who are we?

Mithril Security is a deeptech cybersecurity startup dedicated to make data analysis more secure and privacy friendly.

Mithril Security provides a zero-trust middleware for AI, to enable users to benefit from AI without revealing their data. We help AI providers secure their client’s data to gain their trust, and facilitate compliance in highly regulated areas. We leverage confidential computing to guarantee users’ privacy, through end-to-end encryption.

## 🔐 Protect data at all times

Our goal is to give users the power to utilize cutting-edge security with BlindAI to gain from AI predictions without jeopardizing user data. AI forecasts can be obtained with the assurance that they have never been divulged or made plain, even when working with sensitive data. Data is still end-to-end protected because of the hardware security offered by Intel SGX on top of the software layer we offer (at rest, in transit, and in use).

Although a traditional AI identification system exposes data, our method keeps it safe.
