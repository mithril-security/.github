## üè† Who are we?

Mithril Security is a startup focused on democratizing privacy-friendly AI by leveraging secure hardware. Our solutions aim to ensure that the AI users' data remains confidential and protected at all times!

We are experts in Confidential Computing, a fast-growing field within cybersecurity that centers on the protection of data during computation through isolation and attestation.

## üîê Protect data at all times

Our main project is:

- [BlindLlama](https://github.com/mithril-security/blind_llama), an open-source project to serve Zero-trust AI APIs to help evaluate popular AI models while ensuring users‚Äô data is not exposed to the AI provider thanks to end-to-end protection with secure hardware.

## üìö Archives 

BlindLLama builds on our previous open-source projects (some of which are no longer maintained):

- [BlindAI](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai), a solution for querying and deploying AI models while guaranteeing end-user data privacy, audited by [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/).
- [BlindBox](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindbox), a SaaS deployment solution that boosts compliance and improves the security posture of SaaS solutions by shielding end users' data at all times- including from the SaaS providers themselves.
- [BastionLab](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab), an access-control privacy framework for remote data exploration and AI training.
