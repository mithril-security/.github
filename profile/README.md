## 🏠 Who are we?

Mithril Security develops a data protection and privacy solution for AI analysis. We help developpers, AI engineers and companies to protect their sensitive data when leveraging AI SaaS solutions, enabling them to innovate quickly while preventing leakage risks. 

We are experts in Confidential Computing, a cybersecurity technology we use to ensure that data sent to our APIs remains encrypted from end to end.

## 🔐 Protect data at all times

Our main project is: 
- [BlindAI](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindai), an open-source solution allowing users to query popular AI models or serve their own models with assurances that users' data will remain private. 

We're also working on : 
- [Confidential Computing Explained](https://github.com/mithril-security/Confidential_Computing_Explained), a series of beginner-friendly tutorials to learn how to implement confidential computing solutions.
- [BastionLab](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab), an access-control privacy framework to do remote data exploration and AI training.
